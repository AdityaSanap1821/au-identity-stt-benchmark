<!-- RESULTS_TABLE:END -->

Small WER differences aren't meaningful on this data. Among the most accurate services, differences of less than about 0.25 percentage points are within the 95% confidence interval from bootstrap resampling of the benchmark samples, so those services can't be reliably ranked against each other; the margin is wider for less accurate services.

† Scored by the previous judge (Claude Sonnet 4.5), which reports WER about 15% higher on average than the current judge. These rows will be re-scored.

> **Scoring update (September 2026):** Semantic WER is now judged by Claude Sonnet 5.5, replacing Claude Sonnet 4.5. Repeated words, stutters, and restarts in a transcription no longer count as errors, and a word split in two or merged with its neighbour counts as one error. WER fell for almost every service, by about 13% on average, mostly from fewer counted insertions; the Pareto frontier is unchanged. Earlier results are in the git history. See [Semantic WER](#semantic-wer) for how scoring works.

### Latency vs Accuracy Trade-off

**Typical Latency (Median)**

![STT Service Pareto Frontier - Median](assets/stt_pareto_frontier.png)

The Pareto frontier shows services that offer the best trade-off between latency and accuracy—no other service is better on both metrics. Services on the frontier represent efficient choices depending on your priorities.

Each point is a service's pooled WER. Points close together on the WER axis may not differ meaningfully; see the note under the [results table](#results-summary).

### Latency Consistency

**Median / P95 / P99 by Service**

![STT Service Latency Distribution](assets/stt_latency_range.png)

For production voice agents, **tail latency matters more than median**. Even occasional high latency (5% of interactions) can break the conversational flow. A service with a great median but a long tail indicates inconsistent performance—the length of each row above is the size of that service's latency tail.

### Metrics Glossary

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transcripts** | Percentage of samples where STT successfully returned a transcription. Samples without one are left out of the WER and Perfect columns |
| **Perfect** | Transcriptions with 0% semantic WER, out of the samples with a transcription |
| **WER Mean** | Average semantic word error rate across samples |
| **Pooled WER** | Weighted WER (total errors / total reference words) |
| **TTFS Median** | Median time from user stops speaking to final transcription segment |
| **TTFS P95** | 95th percentile TTFS - worst 5% of samples have latency above this |
| **TTFS P99** | 99th percentile TTFS - worst 1% of samples have latency above this |

> **Semantic WER** measures only transcription errors that would impact an LLM agent's understanding. Punctuation, contractions, filler words, and equivalent phrasings are ignored.

> **TTFS (Time To Final Segment)** is measured from when the user stops speaking to when the final transcription segment is received. For streaming voice agents, lower TTFS means faster response times.

## Contributing a Result

The Results Summary table above is the **single source of truth** for the
published numbers and the Pareto charts. Multiple people contribute, so results
are added one row at a time rather than by rebuilding the whole table. To add
your model's result:

1. Benchmark and score it locally:
   ```bash
   uv run stt-benchmark run --services <key>
   uv run stt-benchmark wer --services <key>
   ```
2. Upsert just your row into the table — this reads only your service's metrics
   from your local database and leaves every other vendor's row untouched:
   ```bash
   uv run stt-benchmark update-readme --services <key>
   ```
3. Regenerate the charts from the table (read-only with respect to the README),
   then commit `README.md` and `assets/*.png`:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/pareto-frontier-plot.py
   ```

A brand-new vendor or model also needs a registry entry first — see
**[Adding Models](docs/adding-models.md)** for the full checklist.

## Measure TTFS for Your Service

If you're using Pipecat and want TTFS latency numbers for your STT service and configuration, see **[Measuring TTFS](docs/measuring-ttfs.md)** for a quick start guide. The P95/P99 values from this tool can be used directly in Pipecat's `ttfs_p99_latency` service configuration (Pipecat 0.0.102+).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Download audio samples
uv run stt-benchmark download --num-samples 100

# Run benchmarks
uv run stt-benchmark run --services deepgram,openai

# Generate ground truth (Gemini)
uv run stt-benchmark ground-truth

# Calculate semantic WER (Claude)
uv run stt-benchmark wer

# View results
uv run stt-benchmark report
```

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd stt-benchmark
uv sync
```

## Environment Variables

Copy `env.example` to `.env` and set your API keys:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

## How It Works

### TTFS Measurement

**TTFS for STT is different from typical request/response latency.** Since STT services receive continuous audio input, there's no discrete request to measure from. Instead, we measure from when the user **stops speaking** to when the **final transcription** arrives.

```

**Key points:**
- `speech_end_time` = `VADUserStoppedSpeakingFrame` timestamp − VAD `stop_secs`
- TTFS = final `TranscriptionFrame` receipt time − `speech_end_time`
- Streaming services emit multiple partial transcripts; we use the **final** one

**Why the final transcript?** For LLM/TTS, there's a discrete input→output making latency measurement simple. For streaming STT, audio flows continuously and generates multiple `TranscriptionFrame`s. We can't know when the STT service finalized audio for intermediate transcripts, so we measure from the final one and use the VAD signal to determine when the user actually stopped speaking.

### Semantic WER

Traditional WER penalizes every word difference equally. "gonna" vs "going to" counts as 2 errors.

**Semantic WER** uses Claude to evaluate whether differences actually matter:

| Ignored (not errors) | Counted (errors) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Punctuation, capitalization | Word substitutions that change meaning |
| Contractions ("don't" → "do not") | Nonsense/hallucinated words |
| Singular/plural ("license" → "licenses") | Missing words that change intent |
| Filler words ("um", "uh") | Wrong names, numbers, negations |
| Number formats ("3" → "three") | Factual errors |
| Repeated words, stutters, and restarts ("I, I guess") | A word split or merged ("backyard" → "back card"), as one error |

This gives accuracy metrics that reflect real-world impact on downstream LLM applications.

The judge lists the errors it finds; the WER is computed from that list, divided by a word count calculated once for each reference, so every service is scored against the same count for the same sentence.

The judge is Claude Sonnet 5.5 with adaptive thinking at `medium` effort, configured in [`semantic_wer.py`](src/stt_benchmark/evaluation/semantic_wer.py). Each result records the judge that produced it, and `stt-benchmark wer` won't add results to a service that another judge scored, since the two sets of scores aren't comparable. After changing the judge, re-score with `--force-recalculate`. To measure a judge before re-scoring with it, use the [judge experiment scripts](scripts/README.md#judge-experiments).

## Supported Services

Each service key is one (vendor, model) pair — a vendor with multiple models has multiple keys (e.g. `cartesia` / `cartesia_ink2`, `assemblyai` / `assemblyai_universal_3_6_pro`). The full list is defined in [`src/stt_benchmark/services.py`](src/stt_benchmark/services.py) (`STT_SERVICES`). To add a model, see [docs/adding-models.md](docs/adding-models.md). See `env.example` for required API keys.
